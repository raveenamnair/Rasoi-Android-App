Rasoi is an Android App that allows you to manage the items in your fridge and reminds you how long you have before they expire. Users can input the items they have bought and based on the category of the food item and its properties, an expiration date is set. You can check back on to the app and see how many days you have left before each item is expired. This application was created using Java in Android Studio. UI Designs were brainstormed using Adobe XD.
